## Problem Statement
>Customer support is overloaded, and traditional chatbots feel robotic, lacking real-time speech, expressive avatars, and adaptive conversations. Businesses face high >query volumes and inefficient help desks, frustrating users and overwhelming support teams. There's a need for an AI assistant that understands natural language, >responds intelligently, and interacts dynamically through speech and visuals, creating an intuitive and immersive experience. The challenge: transforming AI >assistants from static responders into truly engaging entities.

## Proposed Solution
>We introduce two revolutionary AI agents to redefine customer support for IDMS InfoTech:<br>
> • **Myra**, your AI-powered assistant, delivers seamless, human-like interactions through advanced AI and real-time animation, making everyday queries effortless and engaging.<br>
> • **Silas**, your technical assistant, takes it a step further with real-time video calls, offering personalized, face-to-face support for complex issues.
